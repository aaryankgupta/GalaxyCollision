# GalaxyCollision

CS293 Course Project - Data Structures and Algorithms Lab

- Created a 2D Galaxy Collsion simulator using SFML graphics library in C++.
- Implemented the naive brute force algorithm and the Barnes-Hut Algorithm for solving the N-body Problem.
- Made the Quad Tree data structure to store nodes and stars for the Barnes-Hut algorithm

To Run:
Install SFML graphics library on LINUX and open the terminal inside main folder and type command: 

g++ *.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

to compile and after ./a.out choose number of stars and enter

nlogn - Barnes-Hut algorithm

n2- brute force calculation

for algorithm choice.
